Here, you will examine this firsthand with the COMPAS dataset, which is a dataset that has been widely used to predict inmates' likelihood of recidivism (reoffense). First, you will run a simple classifier on this dataset and examine the results. Then, you will be asked how this classifier could be made more fair and, for extra credit, you can try implementing these changes yourself.\n"
